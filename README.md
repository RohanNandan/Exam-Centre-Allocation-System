# Exam-Centre-Allocation-System

A solution created using python, that allocates the nearest exam centre to the student based on the distance between the centre and student's residential address.

**geodesic** module from the **geopy.distance** library is used to calculate the distance.

Two CSV files are fed as inputs namely, Exam Data Base that contains the centre details and the Student database that has the student address.

The final allotment csv file is stored under the name Final Alloted List.
